In order to modify what streamer this displays, add `?user=streamer_name` to the end of the URL. <br>
Now that you have the URL, copy it or save it somewhere so you can begin to use the add-on in OBS

Once you have opened OBS, add a browser source to whatever scene you want this added to. <br>
Click `OK`, and then in the `URL` section paste in the URL you copied earlier. Click `OK` again, and it should be added to your stream! <br>
If you ever want to edit the streamer it shows, click on the source and then click `Properties` and edit the URL.
